These directions are for Linux

Below:
  "GD"="Google Docs"
  "PB"="Pressbooks"

Download GD file by
  File > Download > Web Page (.html, zipped)
let's say into an otherwise empty directory "work," where we will assume you
are now working.

Do:
% unzip *.zip
% mv *.html book.html

Look for a blockquote in the GD, find the corresponding text in book.html .
It will be enclosed in a <span> ... </span>, which will have two classes,
say cX and cY.

Do:
% /path/OOprep -v -b "cX cY" book.html

Run that way, the output will be in "tidy_book.html."

Next: some work on fixing up the html file, partly by hand, partly with tools.
Start with:

% /path/OOoutliner -n -t tidy_book.html | less

There should be no improperly nested headers (OOoutline will warn about them)

All h1 tags should have the form "<h1>Chapter <number>: <chapter title></h1>"

There should be no <img> tags in headers.

Probably no &nbsp; in headers.

Look in tidy_book.html and look at nested <ol>s, GD handles this weirdly

Check for extra <br>s -- some for fake blockquotes, some before </li>

Probabaly remove <hr>s

Look at tables (with table material -- not those used to make a box around text)
and make sure there is a11y awareness, such as cells with <th> instead of <td>.

% /path/OOimg_list -v -o imgs tidy_book.html

Import imgs.docx into PB book

If it's bigger than 25MG, break into pieces each smaller than 25MB, do them one
at a time, put the whole thing back together afterwards.
Visit the new section in PB text editor, copy all html from there into a file
pb_imgs.html on the linux box.

% /path/OOsplit.py -v tidy_book.html

In PB Theme Options make sure
  Part and Chapter numbers  [ ] Display part and chapter numbers
    is *unchecked* and
  Two-Level TOC  [*] Enable two-level table of contents (displays headings under chapter titles)
    is *checked*
  
  Examples
  Header Color	#fff
  Examples Header Background	#4f446d
  Examples Background	#ede5f9
 *this is the one that needs to be changed!*
